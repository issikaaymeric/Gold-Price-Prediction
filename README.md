## **Project Documentation – Gold Price Prediction**

### **1. Overview**

This project predicts gold prices using two approaches:

1. **Linear Regression** – a traditional machine learning algorithm for simple, interpretable predictions.
2. **Deep Learning Neural Network** – a non-linear model capable of capturing complex relationships in the data.

The workflow covers **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization**, enabling a clear comparison between the two methods.

### **2. Dataset**

**File:** `GoldPriceData.csv`

**Columns:**

* **Date**: Date of the record (removed for modeling, as it’s non-numerical).
* **Close**: Gold closing price (target variable).
* **Other numerical features**: Various economic and market indicators influencing gold prices.

**Preprocessing Steps:**

* Removed `Date` column.
* Separated target variable `Close` from input features.
* Standardized features to zero mean and unit variance using `StandardScaler`.
* Split dataset into **80% training** and **20% testing**.

---

### **3. Methodology**

#### **A. Linear Regression Model**

* Algorithm: `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`
* Steps:

  1. Fit the model to training data.
  2. Predict gold prices on the test set.
  3. Evaluate using **MSE** and **R² score**.

**Advantages:** Simple, fast, interpretable.
**Limitations:** Cannot model complex non-linear patterns.

---

#### **B. Deep Learning Model**

* Framework: `TensorFlow Keras`

* Architecture:

  * Dense layer (128 neurons, ReLU)
  * Dropout (20%)
  * Dense layer (64 neurons, ReLU)
  * Dropout (20%)
  * Dense output layer (1 neuron)

* Compilation:

  * Optimizer: **Adam**
  * Loss Function: **Mean Squared Error**

* Training:

  * Epochs: 50
  * Batch size: 32
  * Validation split: 20%

* Evaluation Metrics:

  * **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)
  * **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
  * **R² Score**

**Advantages:** Captures complex non-linear patterns.
**Limitations:** Requires more computation, less interpretable.

---

### **4. Evaluation Metrics**

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Square root of MSE, interpretable in original units.
* **R² Score:** Proportion of variance explained by the model.

### **5. Results Comparison**

| Model                 | MSE     | RMSE    | R² Score |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| **Linear Regression** | *value* | *value* | *value*  |
| **Deep Learning**     | *value* | *value* | *value*  |

> **Note:** Replace *value* with actual results after running the script.

### **6. Visualizations**

#### **For Linear Regression**

* Actual vs Predicted Prices.
* Residual Distribution.

#### **For Deep Learning**

* Training vs Validation Loss.
* Residual Distribution.

---

### **7. Usage**

Run in a Python environment with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

Execute the notebook or script to view evaluation metrics and plots.

---

### **8. Results Interpretation**

* **Linear Regression** is effective for mostly linear relationships.
* **Deep Learning** may excel when feature-target relationships are complex and non-linear.
* Metrics and visualizations together provide a complete performance picture.

---

### **9. Future Improvements**

* Add engineered time-series features (moving averages, volatility).
* Tune deep learning hyperparameters (neurons, layers, dropout).
* Add more economic indicators.
* Experiment with **LSTM** or **XGBoost** for time-series forecasting.
